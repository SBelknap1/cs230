Journal Reflection – The Gaming Room Design Project
This project centered around creating a software design for The Gaming Room, a fictional client who wanted to expand their multiplayer game, “Draw It or Lose It,” to work across multiple platforms like Android, iOS, Windows, and web. The main goals were to make the software scalable, secure, and easily maintainable. They also wanted to reuse as much code as possible between platforms to save time and resources. Basically, they needed a design that would support growth and flexibility without sacrificing performance or user experience.

One of the things I felt most confident about was how clearly I organized the design documentation. I included diagrams like class structure and system flowcharts that helped lay out how each part of the app would work and interact with others. I also wrote descriptions that made sense whether you were a developer or someone from the business side. That was really important to me—making sure the document could communicate well with anyone involved in the project, even if they weren’t super technical.

Going through the design process before any coding started helped a lot more than I expected. It forced me to slow down and really think through the system architecture, the user flow, and what could go wrong. That kind of planning kept me from jumping ahead and writing code that would need to be restructured later. It was also super helpful for spotting parts of the system that needed more thought—like user authentication or game state syncing.

If I were to go back and improve one part, I’d expand the section that deals with error handling and system recovery. I mentioned some general ideas, but I didn’t get into enough detail on how the application would respond to real-time errors across different platforms. That’s something that can really impact user trust, so adding clearer strategies for logging, notifications, and fallback processes would make the design more solid.

Translating user needs into the software design was a major focus for me. I tried to think like the players—how they’d expect the game to behave, what would frustrate them, and what would make their experience better. That led me to prioritize features like responsive design, easy logins, and reliable session tracking. Designing with the end user in mind not only makes the product better, but it also keeps you focused on the actual goals of the software, not just the technical parts.

In terms of my approach, I broke the system into manageable modules and leaned on object-oriented design to keep everything clean and adaptable. I used techniques like UML modeling to sketch out relationships, and I tried to keep separation of concerns in mind while building the architecture. Looking ahead, I want to include more feedback loops early in the design phase—things like quick user interviews, mockups, or even paper prototypes to help test ideas before locking in the structure.wwwww
